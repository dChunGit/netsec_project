Our tool will scan the network for vulnerable IPs . Once we detect the CVE, we can then proceed to fingerprint the server and extract holistic data about our targets, including possibly OS version, open ports, geographic location, among others. This data can then be used to aggregate common environment or network features which could give insight into the applicability, danger, and relevancy of each CVE.
