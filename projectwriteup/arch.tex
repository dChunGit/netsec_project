Our tool will scan the network for vulnerable IPs by fingerprinting each OS, firstly by http header and secondly via methods including a TCP/IP/SYN method described by Han and Du (2010)~\cite{han_du_2010}. We can then proceed to filter by open ports and finally by scanning the actual host for the BlueKeep vulnerability. This scan can consist of detecting the RDP is installed and then  attempting a request/response comparison to check if the vulnerability has been patched or not. Once we have detected a BlueKeep vulnerable machine, we can then proceed to extract holistic data about our targets, including OS version, open ports, geographic location, among others. This data can then be used to aggregate common environment or network features which could give insight into the applicability, danger, and relevancy of BlueKeep.
