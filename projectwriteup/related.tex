Since the CVEs chosen are all related to Apache Server and more specifically versions of Apache server, it is important to determine a method of detecting which server version is actually running to correspond appropriate CVE vulnerabilities with machines on the network. This is what Shodan does to fingerprint each Apache machine on a network. However, normal methods including parsing web banners or sending invalid requests to each server may not work as banners can be forged and requests may not be handled correctly or at all. However, by crafting special requests and parsing the response, it is possible to more robustly fingerprint servers. Methods for creating these requests include detecting request methods, detecting by URL, detecting by protocol statement, and detecting by protocol version. Using a combination of these four in conjunction with the previously discussed normal methods can yield more accurate results.~\cite{huang_xia_sun_xue_2015}
