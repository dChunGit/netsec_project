Since BlueKeep only targets Windows machines ranging from Windows Server 2008 to Windows 7, we need to properly fingerprint each IP's host machine to determine likely candidates for this vulnerability. However, the header fields in the http request/responses may not be accurate. To increase confidence and properly identify the host machine OS, we can use an approach described by Han and Du (2010)~\cite{han_du_2010} which identifies OS by TCP/IP fingerprint. This paper uses a method in which a host can be fingerprinted via an open TCP port. The method described in this approach constructs a TCP packet, initiates a connection handshake protocol, and records the protocol fingerprints found in the TCP response header. Once recorded, the data gathered is used to compare the behavior with a database of OS fingerprints to accurately judge the host OS type and version.
