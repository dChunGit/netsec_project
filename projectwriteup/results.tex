For the chosen CVEs, we expect to see a very wide range of vulnerable machines as the range of exploitable versions is high for many. For the longer running CVEs, the machines found should most likely be a mix of older and newer OS's while the more recently discovered CVEs, we would expect to be running on more recent machines. In comparison to Shodan, we expect to detect a similar number of vulnerable machines on the network.
