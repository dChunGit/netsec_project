The proliferation of working remotely led to the need for remote desktop
access. Microsoft created the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as a remote
desktop solution for Windows. Millions of machines now have RDP 
enabled, exposing their computers to potential attacks.

CVE-2019-0708 ``BlueKeep'' was first reported in May 2019 and affects
all unpatched versions of Windows betweek Windows 2000 and Windows 
Server 2008 R2/Windows 7. Windows RDP has services bound to any of 
32 channels. Attackers can request a SVC named MS\_T120 and bind to
any channel other than 31, which will cause a  heap corruption and allow
for arbitrary code execution.

To detect BlueKeep, we plan to scan the internet and fingerprint each 
operating system to find potentially vulnerable systems. We will then
determine whether RDP is enabled by searching for its port.
