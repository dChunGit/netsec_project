We aim to detect systems vulnerable to CVE-2019-0708, also 
known as ''BlueKeep,'' a critical vulnerability in the Windows 
Remote Desktop Protocol. We approach the problem by
scanning and fingerprinting OS version, looking for an 
exposed RDP port, and then confirming vulnerability through
a request/response comparison. We can aggregate information
about vulnerable hosts to analyze the scope and severity of 
this vulnerability. We also compare our scan to existing tools
such as Shodan.
