In a paper by Li, Avellino, Janies, and Collins (2016)~\cite{li_avellino_janies_collins_2016}, they discuss a tool designed to improve vulnerability management via detection and monitoring called the Software Asset Analyzer (SAA). This scanner addresses a few key scenarios that could lead to vulnerable systems, namely unapproved software download, failure to upgrade, lack of knowledge of installed applications, and remediation verification. To detect the potential install of vulnerable CPEs and verify it has been properly dealt with, the SAA tool takes a blacklist and checks network hosts for unauthorized CPEs by analyzing their individual configurations. By first scanning the system, the SAA tool will mark it as safe if three distinct checks are passed: all required CPEs are present, no blacklisted CPE is present, and only one version of a CPE is installed at a time. Once marked as safe, this configuration is used for future comparison analysis, thus accounting for deviations between CPE configurations on different machines. While this particular tool concentrates on categorizing the CPEs, a next step mentioned in the paper is to ``incorporate a scoring system such as CVE, NVD, and CVSS''~\cite{li_avellino_janies_collins_2016} to assess overall vulnerability of network machines. We will take this emphasis on analyzing for CVEs and scan for such vulnerabilities, specifically concentrating on the BlueKeep vulnerability for the Windows operating system. Once we filter out and detect the vulnerable machines, we can then collect network addresses, site type, and similar holistic data to gather statistics for BlueKeep vulnerable environments in order to try to detect commonalities.
