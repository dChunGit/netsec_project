In a paper by Li, Avellino, Janies, and Collins (2016)~\cite{li_avellino_janies_collins_2016}, they discuss a system designed to improve vulnerability management via detection and monitoring. One of the core issues covered in this paper is the case of user's failure to upgrade to a patched version of their software services, leading to increased system vulnerability. While they concentrate on categorizing the CPEs, a next step mentioned in the paper is to ``incorporate a scoring system such as CVE, NVD, and CVSS''~\cite{li_avellino_janies_collins_2016} to assess vulnerability of networks. We will take this emphasis on network vulnerability and scan for vulnerabilities, specifically concentrating on the BlueKeep vulnerability for the Windows operating system. Once we filter out and detect the vulnerable machines, we will then collect network addresses, site type, and similar holistic data to gather statistics for BlueKeep vulnerable environments in order to try to detect commonalities.
