In a paper by Li, Avellino, Janies, and Collins (2016)~\cite{li_avellino_janies_collins_2016}, they discuss a system designed to improve vulnerability management via detection and monitoring. One of the core issues covered in this paper is the case of user's failure to upgrade to a patched version of their software services, leading to increased system vulnerability. While they concentrate on categorizing the CPEs, a next step mentioned in the paper is to ``incorporate a scoring system such as CVE, NVD, and CVSS''~\cite{li_avellino_janies_collins_2016} to assess vulnerability of networks. We will take this emphasis on network vulnerability and scan for vulnerabilities, specifically concentrating on Apache server CVEs. Then, we will collect network addresses, Apache version and similar holistic data to gather statistics on common vulnerability environments.
